# 20 Games Challenge

This repository contains my attempt at the [20 Games Challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/).
In brief, the goal is master the fundamentals of gamedev by developing 20 small games.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Given the self-imposed time-limitation, the code will not be of production quality!

## Rules

- Each game should take no more than 20-30 hours to develop.
- The tech stack must be C running on both desktop and wasm.
- Dependencies can be used for complex subsystems, e.g. physics and asset loading, but no game engine nor framework should be used.

## Roadmap
10 of the games will be recreations of classic games, as suggested by the 20 Games Challenge while the remaining will be game jam entries.
Note that for the recreations the goal is to make a "vertical slice" which captures the essence of the original game.
